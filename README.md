# Spaceship Game

A small demo "game" made in vanilla JS with HTML canvas.
In it, two spaceships are controlled by a single keyboard, flying around a star.

The repository was created as part of a Git workshop and is meant to be used by the participants to exercise specific shared repository workflows.
